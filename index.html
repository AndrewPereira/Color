        <h2>Time with Friends</h2>
        <img src="image1.jpeg">
        <p> My social life is very important to me. My social life is the time I get to hang out with my friends, relax and catch up. My friends and I love to go downtown, do some shopping than end the night with a nice dinner. We also like to hang out at Starbucks and just talk and laugh about anything. My favouite thing to do with my friends is get all of them together and go to a concert.

        <p> I've only ever been out of the country once, and only been to one other place. I've always wanted to go to Los Angeles but I did't actually go until two years ago when I was eighteen years old. I loved every moment of my trp, all the landmarks I saw, the famous restuarants I ate at. It was a dream come true. My next trip I have planned is to Orlando, Florida where I will be going to Disney with all my friends. My trip to Los Angeles opened up my eyes to how fun traveling is and how much I enjoy it.

        <h2>Concert Addiction</h2>
        <img src="CF327F7D-8F74-48E8-A478-CF137931E226.JPG">
        <p> To spend my spare time I love going to concerts. Going to concerts makes me feel so much more coonected to the artists. Live performances I beleive are the best way to experience music, you get the true artists self when you watch and listen to them perform. My favoutie acts include Adele, Ed Sheeran,Justin Bieber, The Weeknd, Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift.

        <h2>Film</h2>
        <iframe width="350" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5CS0mn_A1fA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p> Film is a passion of mine, ever since I was little. I was always amazed at how some of my faourite scences were pulled off. One my favouitie films Psycho was very influential in attracting me to film. When I first watched that film I was in awe in how the camera almost became a charcter in its self. The camera helped audiences understand what was happening and forshadow events without dialouge. The film was perfectly paced and had some of the best suspense in a film every created.  This was the first true film that truely shocked and surprised me. That film convinced me that this is what I want to create and share to the world.
