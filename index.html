<p>I ended up choosing this photo because it uses a lot of neutral colours but also stands out. I believe neutral colours are the best colour scheme when it comes to creating most websites. I believe that the colour scheme of a website shouldn't be popping of the screen into the viewers face unless thats the point for example a news site. The neutral colours allow for the content to take centre stage while also having a cooler scheme that is pleasing to look at. While the main focus is content the colour scheme needs to elevate that content to make it more appealing to the viewers so, the neutral colours are welcoming and warm. I can see this colour scheme being used for nature blogs, travel sites and e-commerce websites. All could use the colour scheme as well as shades and tints of each colour to execute an aesthetically pleasing website. </p>
